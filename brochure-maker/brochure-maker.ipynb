      "As global commerce accelerates,\n",
      "Adyen\n",
      ", a publicly-traded financial technology platform, is helping large companies like Meta, Uber, H&M, and Microsoft achieve their ambitions faster by providing end-to-end payments capabilities, data-driven insights, and financial products in a single global solution.\n",
      "With more merchants signing on and with increased transaction volume comes increased pressure on support teams and a team at Adyen that immediately sought out leveraged solutions. \"We are engineers so we are always looking at ways to scale our business using technology without having to increase the team size,” said Andreu Mora, SVP of Engineering - Data. “We want to understand, harness, and advance technology like LLMs to make our teams and customers more efficient and more satisfied.”\n",
      "Adyen spun up a new and lean team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers based out of their new Tech Hub in\n",
      "Madrid, Spain\n",
      "to take on a range of high-impact projects, with the initial goal of accelerating support teams.\n",
      "Solution\n",
      "Focusing on support team efficiency and satisfaction led the team to an insight that passing tickets between teams was a major factor influencing response times. This challenge was particularly well-suited to be solved by two initial LLM applications:\n",
      "A smart ticket routing system designed to get a ticket to the right support person as quickly as possible based on content\n",
      "A support agent copilot designed to help agents answer tickets faster and more accurately with an approach they call\n",
      "Question Answering Suggestions\n",
      ".\n",
      "Adyen decided to use LangChain to build it because they could rely on a single, easy-to-customize, framework to get from prototype to production, and avoid getting locked into a single model as they experimented. They also relied on LangSmith, LangChain’s developer platform to evaluate performance of their applications and compare how different underlying models affected response quality and costs.\n",
      "LangChain’s flexibility allowed Adyen to switch the core part of the chain among various LLMs with ease. To ensure seamless interactions with their internal LLM API endpoint, they introduced a custom class extending from LangChain’s base LLM class, and integrated it with an event-driven microservice architecture hosted in a Kubernetes cluster. For a more in-depth exploration of the technical aspects behind Adyen's smart ticket routing and support agent copilot, check out the technical deep dive by\n",
      "Andreu Mora\n",
      "and\n",
      "Rafael Hernandez\n",
      "(Team Lead of Operations AI) on the Adyen blog\n",
      "here\n",
      ".\n",
      "Results\n",
      "More efficient and accurate ticket routing\n",
      "The foundation of Adyen’s smart ticket router is an internal tool that analyzes the theme and sentiment of each ticket, and dynamically updates its priority based on the user.  With Adyen’s wide array of products, features & services, this LLM-driven approach enables merchants to receive support from the technical experts most suited to respond quickly.\n",
      "Quicker support response times\n",
      "In just 4 months the Adyen team was able to build a comprehensive collection of relevant documents (combining public and private company documents) and store them in a vector database with an embedding model that optimized for effective retrieval. The team’s first milestone on its way to generating proposed ticket responses was finding the most relevant and up-to-date document from a collection of public and private documents. This approach far outperformed traditional keyword-based search and, just as importantly, immediately established the team’s trust in the new system.\n",
      "The next step was to connect to an LLM to produce a suggested response for support agents through their proprietary copilot. “With the right set of tickets in their queues and easily-modifiable potential answers to customer inquiries at their fingertips, support agents are more efficient and more satisfied.” said Andreu.\n",

      "Is LangChain still useful if I’m only using one model or vector database provider?\n",
      "Yes - LangChain is valuable even if you’re using one provider. Its LangChain Expression Language standardizes methods such as parallelization, fallbacks, and async for more durable execution. We also provide observability out of the box with LangSmith, making the process of getting to production more seamless.\n",
      "Is LangChain open source?\n",
      "Yes - LangChain is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.\n",
      "What are the most common ways people use LangChain?\n",
      "LangChain is often used for chaining together a series of LLM calls or for retrieval augmented generation. We recommend you try out\n",
      "LangGraph\n",
      "if you want to build an agent.\n",
      "Can I use LangChain in production?\n",
      "Yes, LangChain 0.1 and later are production-ready. We've streamlined the package, which has fewer dependencies for better compatibility with the rest of your code base. We're also committed to no breaking changes on any minor version of LangChain after 0.1, so you can upgrade your patch versions (e.g., 0.2.x) on any minor version without impact.\n",
      "Is LangChain suitable for the enterprise?\n",
      "Yes, LangChain is widely used by Fortune 2000 companies. Many enterprises use LangChain to future-proof their stack, allowing for the easy integration of additional model providers as their needs evolve. Visit our  to see how companies are using LangChain.\n",
      "How is LangChain different from LangGraph?\n",
      "For straight-forward chains and retrieval flows, start building with LangChain using LangChain Expression Language to piece together components. If you’re building agents or need complex orchestration, use\n",

      "How easy is it to start using LangSmith if I use LangChain?\n",
      "Getting started is as easy as setting three environment variables in your LangChain code. When you use the LangSmith SDK, there’s a callback handler to collect traces and send them to your LangSmith Organization.

      "Will LangSmith add latency to my application?\n",
      "No, LangSmith does not add any latency to your application. In the LangSmith SDK, there’s a callback handler that sends traces to a LangSmith trace collector which runs as an async, distributed process. Additionally, if LangSmith experiences an incident, your application performance will not be disrupted.\n",

      "Do I need to use LangChain to use LangGraph? What’s the difference?\n",
      "No. LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows.\n",
      "How is LangGraph different from other agent frameworks?\n",
      "Other agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.\n",
      "Does LangGraph impact the performance of my app?\n",
      "LangGraph will not add any overhead to your code and is specifically designed with streaming workflows in mind.\n",
      "Is LangGraph open source? Is it free?\n",
      "Yes. LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.\n",
      "How are LangGraph and LangGraph Platform different?\n",
      "LangGraph is a stateful, orchestration framework that brings added control to agent workflows. LangGraph Platform is a service for deploying and scaling LangGraph applications, with an opinionated API for building agent UXs, plus an integrated developer studio.\n",

      "Is LangGraph Platform open source?\n",
      "No. LangGraph Platform is proprietary software.\n",
      "There is a free, self-hosted version of LangGraph Platform with access to basic features. The Cloud SaaS deployment option is free while in beta, but will eventually be a paid service.
